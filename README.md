Grab your layout ['Print this layout'] PDF from the oryx website [https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts]
drag the PDF into photoshop with the default settings (see below), remove the white background, trim the image and replace the PNG in the 'keydox/images' folder, if your PDF is two pages like mine, you will have to stitch it into one image with the same padding.
